The school's Applied Learning Programme_ a Thinking Curriculum @ Cantonment Primary School (TC@CPS) is to develop and encourage 'Innovative Thinkers' through a school wide approach.   TC@CPS identifies specific higher order thinking skills for each level_  to give better structure and form in teaching these skills eg. to 'create' at P5 and P6. Different strategies are adopted suited for the different subjects. To give a common language for discourse all teachers are trained in the 'Visible Thinking' approach through an on-line course by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Students use the thinking strategies in the classrooms to learn about subject content. There are four levels of programmes that offer scope and depth for learning and practice. The first is at the classroom level_ the second through school wide activities beyond the classroom_ the third for students with specific inclinations and the fourth in external competitions and platforms. TC@CPS is to cultivate responsible and independent thinkers who will contribute positively to the community.  Our efforts to encourage concerned citizenship is also through our anchor Values Education (VE) lessons and activities; a key vehicle for achieving the Character and Citizenship Education intents and goals.

Riding on the push for STEM education_ our Robotics and Computing Programme and new Data Literacy module equip our students with creative problem-solving_ analytical and programming skills. Our Environmental and Sustainability Education prepares our students to be future-ready leaders who reflect and research on the challenges that the world faces through experiential and collaborative learning experiences that take them beyond the classroom. Our MOE Art Elective Programme (AEP) adopts the Lincoln Centre Education approach that develops students' capacities for imagination and enables them to realise their artistic potential through a rigorous 4-year programme. Complementing this_ the Glocal Perspective Education nurtures students to be cultured_ caring and global citizens with a 'think-global-act-local' education by providing them with a plethora of opportunities to engage in a range of cultural activities and global immersion opportunities. The Student Leadership Programme nurtures forward-looking leaders with integrity and commitment to serve the school_ community and nation and provides tiered leadership training and experiences to all students to level up their leadership competencies.
