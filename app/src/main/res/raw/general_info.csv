Cultivating this culture and tone is each staff member's responsibility and is demonstrated in the different facets of the school's curriculum deliveries; in how lessons are planned_ how learning is shared_ how safety is managed_ how discipline is enforced and how relationships and partnerships are built. We also believe that a caring and collaborative culture does not compromise on the high academic standards and rigor expected. On the contrary; because a caring culture is about accountability for the students' academic performance_ accountability to address the varied student needs_ and accountability for the quality of programs offered_ and because a collaborative culture is about progressing sharper learning with the help of others and vice versa.  A caring culture is the base from which we develop students who are ""Concerned citizens_ Innovative Thinkers_ Inspired for Excellence_ Service and Influence"" as articulated in our school vision. In the course of their six-year journey_ we hope that our students strengthen the caring culture in how they conduct themselves as a member of the school and community and in what they accomplish for self and for school.

This future oriented vision recognises that our students need to possess skills_ aptitudes and attitudes in order to succeed and contribute in the 21st century. The school's Applied Learning Programme_ a Thinking Curriculum @ Cantonment Primary School (TC@CPS) is to develop and encourage 'Innovative Thinkers' through a school wide approach.   TC@CPS identifies specific higher order thinking skills for each level_  to give better structure and form in teaching these skills eg. to 'create' at P5 and P6. Different strategies are adopted suited for the different subjects. To give a common language for discourse all teachers are trained in the 'Visible Thinking' approach through an on-line course by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Students use the thinking strategies in the classrooms to learn about subject content. There are four levels of programmes that offer scope and depth for learning and practice. The first is at the classroom level_ the second through school wide activities beyond the classroom_ the third for students with specific inclinations and the fourth in external competitions and platforms. TC@CPS is to cultivate responsible and independent thinkers who will contribute positively to the community.  Our efforts to encourage concerned citizenship is also through our anchor Values Education (VE) lessons and activities; a key vehicle for achieving the Character and Citizenship Education intents and goals. VE is similarly school-wide and tiered by design.

Cultured .  Aspiring Learners,To Build Character_ Nurture Minds and Strive for Excellence,We are guided by the belief that 'Every Child Learns' and our efforts are directed at providing opportunities through our programmes as well as teachable moments. Children are imbued with this mindset and have self-belief and self-efficacy.  We define culture as a way of life and life in school includes every day interacting and connecting with Singaporeans and children from other countries. We ensure that children appreciate each other's differences and diversity_ as school is a microcosm of Society and such awareness must be built from young. To be cultured is to conduct oneself with dignity_ to be humble and not be respecters of persons but respect everyone.  We want our children not only to learn but learn right. Anything that is worth doing must be done well_ even if it is to keep the individual desks tidy and classrooms clean. We encourage them to aspire to do their best and to try again when they face setbacks.  All that we do is premised on the values of Integrity_ Responsibility_ Resilience and Compassion. We ensure that the values are lived out so that they are not just taught but caught. It is not enough to be honest but exhibit integrity - the moral courage to speak up or own up when something wrong has been committed; everyone must be responsible to his own work; we allow mistakes to be made so that they build resilience and when they are successful_ to always remember those who are less advantaged than them and show compassion by contributing back to Society.   In NSPS we constantly build our teacher capacity through adopting a school-wide model of 'The Skillful Teacher'. We encourage our teachers to try different strategies so that they engage the children and bring about the 'joy of learning'. Teachers also frequently attend workshops and courses for fresh ideas.   All the above brings about a culture of care and every child can look forward to school_ having a positive teacher-student relationship and quality school experience.,SENG KANG,NORTH,NORTH 4,GOVERNMENT SCHOOL,CO-ED SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,PRIMARY,No,No,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,School's LLP1 is Community Service and Student Leadership.

It enables the pupils not only in collaborative thinking but also critical thinking (P1-6)  An extension of LLP1 has been the development of iTrails - a collaboration between CCE and Science departments to enthuse children to tap on technology to do outdoor learning in matters such as environmental conservation. They also create their own games and this builds children's creative and inventive thinking and skills. They also learn to work in a team and appreciate the different perspectives of their classmates. (P3-6)  School's LLP2 is Sports and Outdoor Education Play Your Hearts Out@North Spring aims to build in the children agility_ flexibility_ dexterity_ nimbleness and also a love for an active lifestyle. We hope this will become a life-long habit so that they lead active healthy lives. The children are put through a series of skills-based games and in their 6 years at NSPS they will cover rope-skipping_ dancesport_ netball_ tag rugby_ lacrosse and tchoukball. These are complemented by a rigorous PE curriculum and robust PAL - Programme for Active Learning which also includes visual art_ music_ drama and dance skills. This is further strengthened by school's participation in HPB's Healthy Meals in Schools Programme and establishment of a culture of eating right. We believe that a healthy child is a happy child who learns well.,-1,-1

The school has kept on course by providing young girls of all races_ religions and backgrounds with a unique brand of education distinctive of the Convent. The school's mission characterized by values of humility and service reflected in the motto of all CHIJ schools around the world - ""Simple in Virtue_ Steadfast in Duty""_ is an identity worn with pride by every Convent girl. Capitalizing on the unique opportunities afforded in an all-girls' school_ the convent education provided in CHIJ Kellock is a commitment to recognizing the dignity of young ladies. The school recognizes that every girl is an individual who can and should strive to do her personal best for herself and for others and is therefore_ committed to staying relevant and responsive to the changing educational landscape and demands of the 21st century.  The three tenets of the school vision; LEARN_ LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE are realised in the school's strategic directions to develop every Kellock girl's unique giftedness to become a Thoughtful Learner (LEARN)_ a Servant Leader (LEAD) and a Person for Others (MAKE A DIFFERENCE).

As a Christ-centred Learning Community_ the students in the school receive a values-based learning experience that pushes them not just to learn but to LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE_ anchored on a set of values that form the compass for their words_ actions and deeds.  The explicit teaching of values during lessons is done through specially customised Values-Education Lessons that supplement the usual Character and Citizenship Education programme. These lessons teach the students explicitly about what it means to think_ speak and act in accordance to the school values_ Complementing this effort is the school's Values Alive Series - a series of morning assembly talks conducted by student leaders  to share real life examples of people who have lived out the school values in extraordinary ways.  To help the students translate the values learnt into positive habits and attitudes_ the school's PE and Sports CCA curriculum guides the children into thinking about and using relevant habits (inspired by Steven Covey's 8 habits) in their lesson. This Learning for Life programme (LLP) called Net Infinity puts values into action. Similarly_ the school's annual Values@Play event provides another platform for students to make connections to the values of Friendship_ Excellence_ Respect_ Resilience and Integrity through specially-designed games.   Central to and of significance to the Kellock Experience is the school's desired outcomes for the girls of the school to be persons of others that will make a difference_ no matter their age.
